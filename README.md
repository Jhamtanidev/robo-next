WanderSub is a state-of-the-art underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV)

## Our Team
We are a dynamic team of five dedicated students hailing from diverse branches of engineering â€“ Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Information Technology.
Currently in our third year of undergraduate studies at SVIT, our collective passion and drive are focused on reshaping the way humanity explores the underwater realm.
Our journey has been guided by the invaluable expertise of our college alumnus, Arpit Shah, and his accomplished team.
Their mentorship and support have played a pivotal role in propelling our remotely operated vehicle (ROV) towards unprecedented success.
With a shared vision and relentless determination, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible beneath the waves.
Together, we are not just students; we are innovators on a mission to revolutionize underwater exploration.
